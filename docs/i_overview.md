### Introduction

Normally I am a computer scientist with a focus on data science and software engineering located in Nuremberg (QTH JN59NK). Today I want to **share my radio signal hobby** with all of you. My callsign is [DD7MB](https://dd7mb.de).

**This page is about automatic (live) monitoring/reporting of different radio signals and sdr related topics**. Unfortunately, this page is under construction and is not complete. This page has started on 04-Mar-2022 and there are a lot of things to publish and do. So check back from time to time.

I am starting with publishing FT8-signal maps received with my loop antenna. I added WEFAX, SSTV (from ISS) and SSTV (from HAM Radio) sections.

The setup is based on GNU Radio & self-developed tools/software in Python and C++. Timestamps are specified in UTC. New FT8 data is automatically published every two hours. The diagrams with time axis always refer to the last 7 days. The *Number of received signals by day* plot is an exception to this.
