### Introduction

Welcome to my [Software-defined radio (SDR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio) page.

Normally I am a computer scientist with a focus on data science and software engineering located in Germany near Munich (QTH JN58). Today I want to **share my radio signal hobby** with all of you. I currently have no amateur radio license, but I am on it.

Instead of learning for the amateur radio license, I am dealing with **automatic signal identification, classification, monitoring, demodulation & decoding of voice, data & natural radio signals**. I am using traditional methods and machine learning (ml) / artificial intelligence (ai) techniques for these points.

**This page is about automatic (live) monitoring/reporting of different radio signals and sdr related topics**. Unfortunately, this page is under construction and is not complete. This page has started on 04-Mar-2022 and there are a lot of things to publish and do. So check back from time to time.

I am starting with publishing FT8-signal maps received with my loop antenna. The other day I added the WEFAX-receiving section. I am looking forward to a satellite-receiving section and other cool projects.

The setup is based on GNU Radio & self-developed tools/software in Python and C++. Timestamps are specified in UTC. New FT8 data is automatically published every two hours.
